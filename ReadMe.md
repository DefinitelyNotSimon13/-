Hey there this is my hyprland config etc...

# DISCLAIMER 
WARNING- MAJOR **WORK IN PROGRESS**

My config is inspired by the Catppuccin Mocha theme.

# CREDIT
Credit where credit is due!
I have taken a lot of inspiration from many different sources - Since this repo is in very early stages I most certainly have forgotten many mentions.
> Please feel free to add/edit any ReadMe files with missing credit! I'll do my best to add credit as I go along1

# WIP
Many things may not work without dependencies. While I'll do my best to add an install script with as many dependencies as possible, feel free to DM me if you need help/I forget anything - which is very likely!

# TODO
- Add more credit/mentions
- Update ReadMe files to look good
- Add proper scripts for depencies
- Write own neovim config and move away from NVCHAD
- More customisation and ricing

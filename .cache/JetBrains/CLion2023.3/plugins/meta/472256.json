Suitability under various light conditions is a must.</li>\n  <li><strong>Harmony is superior to dissonance</strong>: vivacious colors must complement each other.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\n<p>There are 4 lovely flavours for you to choose from: <strong>Latte</strong>, <strong>FrappÃ©</strong>, <strong>Macchiato</strong> and <strong>Mocha</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>User Interface</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Head to <strong>Settings</strong> â†’ <strong>Appearance &amp; Behaviour</strong> â†’ <strong>Appearance</strong></li>\n  <li>Pick your favourite flavour</li>\n  <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Restart your IDE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Code Editor</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Head to <strong>Settings</strong> â†’ <strong>Editor</strong> â†’ <strong>Color Scheme</strong></li>\n  <li>Pick your favourite flavour</li>\n  <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> Restart your IDE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Icon Pack</h4>\n\n<p>\nWe have created an icon pack to compliment this theme!

{"id":474473,"xmlId":"com.github.copilot","name":"GitHub Copilot","description":"<h2>What’s GitHub Copilot</h2><p>GitHub Copilot provides autocomplete-style suggestions from an AI pair programmer as you code. You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.</p><h2>Powered by OpenAI</h2><p>It is powered by OpenAI Codex to work in real time, right from your editor. GitHub Copilot improves developer productivity and happiness, reducing disruptions, improving flow and increasing the amount of time a developer spends doing satisfying work.</p><p>Unlike other code assistants, GitHub Copilot offers suggestions from a model that OpenAI built from billions of lines of open source code.</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>Your code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement\">Privacy Statement</a> to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fgithub-copilot%2Fsignup\">Start a free trial with GitHub Copilot</a></p><h2>What can you do with GitHub Copilot?</h2><p><strong>Convert comments to code</strong> <br>\nGitHub Copilot uses a special version of GPT-3 that has been trained on a large body of public source code. It is as good at writing natural language as it is at writing code, so in fact it can complete your comments for you. In the example below, we first let it complete our explanation, and then, line by line, we tab through the code that does what we just said in English.</p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/289648/214809520-9fa3cad7-841e-4062-8ac3-cf2b91d2795f.gif\">\n<p><strong>Create unit tests</strong> <br>\nAn important use case of GitHub Copilot is to take some of the drudgery out of writing unit tests. Below, we already have an implementation of a function that computes the Greatest Common Divisor, and we want to test that. To do so, we simply start writing what we want to test. From then on, it’s plain sailing, and we accept the test cases by tabbing through the suggestions.</p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/289648/214809528-f49f5fe9-01a7-45f4-b6f9-74bb028cafee.gif\">\n<p><strong>Create a SQL query</strong> <br>\nEvery developer needs to write SQL every now and then, right? Everytime the same question pops up. What was the the correct syntax of this query? GitHub Copilot can answer that, just show it the schema as CREATE TABLE statements. And then, it nicely writes a working SQL query.</p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/289648/214809534-e5fbb558-16d6-465f-aec5-4a50f5d66a76.gif\">\n<h2>Chat with GitHub Copilot (now in private beta)</h2><p>GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions directly within a supported IDE. Copilot Chat can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code.

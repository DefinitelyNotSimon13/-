**Assistant:**

I noticed your `include(LoadEnv)` on line 5. This command is used to load a CMake module file. If the loading process fails, it means that CMake couldn't find a module with the specified name.

Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure the `LoadEnv.cmake` file exists in the directory `"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake"`. This is because you've appended this path to the `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. If the file doesn't exist in this location, the `include` command will fail.

2. Check the casing of the `LoadEnv.cmake` file. File systems on Linux are case-sensitive, so `LoadEnv.cmake` and `loadenv.cmake` would be considered as two different files.

3. Check the content of the `LoadEnv.cmake` file. If there are any syntax errors or other issues, the `include` command will fail.

**Assistant:**

I noticed your `include(LoadEnv)` on line 5. This command is used to load a CMake module file. If the loading process fails, it means that CMake couldn't find a module with the specified name.

Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure the `LoadEnv.cmake` file exists in the directory `"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake"`. This is because you've appended this path to the `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. If the file doesn't exist in this location, the `include` command will fail.

2. Check the casing of the `LoadEnv.cmake` file. File systems on Linux are case-sensitive, so `LoadEnv.cmake` and `loadenv.cmake` would be considered as two different files.

3. Check the content of the `LoadEnv.cmake` file. If there are any syntax errors or other issues, the `include` command will fail.

**Assistant:**

The error message suggests that the `target_link_libraries` command in your `CMakeLists.txt` is trying to link against `mongo::bsoncxx_shared`, but this target was not found. It's possible that this package was not correctly installed. However, according to your output log, it seems like `vcpkg` did install the `mongo-cxx-driver` package. 

Here are a few possibilities:

1. The installations of the driver dependencies (like `libbson`, `mongo-c-driver`) could have gone through correctly, but there might have been some issue with the `mongo-cxx-driver`. Try to reinstall these packages.

2. Make sure you're calling `find_package(bsoncxx CONFIG REQUIRED)` and `find_package(mongocxx CONFIG REQUIRED)` before the `target_link_libraries` command. 

3. The target name could be outdated or might have changed in newer versions. Try to replace `mongo::bsoncxx_shared` with `mongo::bsoncxx` or `mongo::bsoncxx_static`. 

If none of the above solutions work, consider posting this issue in the mongo-cxx-driver GitHub issues page or check the existing issues. There might be others who have faced a similar problem and their discussions could lend you some insights.

how do I add the libraries properly when i am using vcpkg in amnifest  kde?

**Assistant:**

When using vcpkg manifest mode (which means using a `vcpkg.json` file), there are several steps you need to perform to correctly link your libraries.

1. **Specify Dependencies in vcpkg.json**: Before you can use vcpkg in manifest mode, you need to properly set up your `vcpkg.json`. The dependencies/object is used to specify a list of libraries that vcpkg should manage. Here is an example:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Ergos",
     "version-string": "0.0.1",
     "dependencies": [
       {
         "name": "mongo-cxx-driver",
         "features": [ ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Here, `mongo-cxx-driver` is used as dependency. Please, replace it with whatever libraries you want to use.

2. **CMakeLists.txt**: Now, vcpkg will automatically handle the process of downloading and building the specified library. To use the library in your project, add a `find_package` call in your `CMakeLists.txt` and link to the libraries. It should look something like this:

   ```cmake
   find_package(mongo-cxx-driver CONFIG REQUIRED)
   add_executable(main main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE mongo::bsoncxx_shared mongo::mongocxx_shared)
   ```
   Replace `mongo::bsoncxx_shared` and `mongo::mongocxx_shared` with the libraries you want to link with your project.

3. **Building Your Project**: When building your project, you need to pass the toolchain file to CMake so it can locate the libraries managed by vcpkg. By default, the toolchain file is located at [`<vcpkg_root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#integrate-into-an-existing-project) .

   Normally, CMake and vcpkg together perform the following:
      1. Download and build any libraries that haven't been installed yet.
      2. Link your project against the installed libraries.
      3. Include the necessary directories from installed libraries.

If you still have problems when trying to link libraries or any other issue, don't hesitate to ask!

Disable Visual Studio configurations and modify generation paths

Visual Studio configurations in cmake.xml file have been disabled. The generation paths have also been adjusted to reflect a different development environment. New configurations for 'Debug', 'Release', 'RelWithDebInfo', and 'MinSizeRel' have been enabled with updated paths.

Update CMakeLists file with new library paths

The include directive in CMakeLists.txt has been refined to use the full path to the loadEnv.cmake file instead of just LoadEnv. The shared MongoDB libraries have been replaced with their static equivalents.

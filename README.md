Hey there this is my hyprland config with everything else I remembered to add.

# DISCLAIMER 
WARNING- MAJOR **WORK IN PROGRESS**

I only started to get into linux (like properly - not just downloading popOS! and effectively using it like Windows) and all the stuff like wayland, compositors, etc.. in the past week. 
As such there may be a few (or maybe even a lot) of points, that are done properly or may even cause errors etc. Please feel free to critize anything you deem inapropriately done.
I am running this config with arch.


# Theme inspiration
My config is inspired by the Catppuccin Mocha theme.
I have taken massive inspiration from [u/meow-64](https://www.reddit.com/user/meow-64)'s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ykt6z1/hyprland_catppuccin_with_hyprland) in r/unixporn. Here lays the base for most of the configuration I did!
Without his post this repo would not exist.

# CREDIT
Generally all repos etc around catppuccin can be credited here.
Credit where credit is due!
I have taken a lot of inspiration from many different sources - Since this repo is in very early stages I most certainly have forgotten many mentions.
> Please feel free to add/edit any ReadMe files with missing credit! I'll do my best to add credit as I go along

# WIP
Many things may not work without dependencies. While I'll do my best to add an install script with as many dependencies as possible, feel free to DM me if you need help/I forget anything - which is very likely!

# TODO
- Add more credit/mentions
- Get screenshots working - currently only black
- Make and add screenshots
- Add CONTRIBUTE.md and properly set up repo with settings and stuff
- Update ReadMe files to look good
- Add proper scripts for depencies
- Write own neovim config and move away from NVCHAD
- Declare/decide on proper standart programms (e.g. currently having both brave and firefox)
- Add other configs (e.g. firefox userStyles -I just gotta figure out how to best do it)
- Massively update/improve rofi config
- Change my wallpaper(s)
- Customize neofetch
- setup cliphist
- More customisation and ricing
- Add more scripts
- Change Workspace indicator
  - Automatically add things like gcm?
- Add keybindig overview (hyprland, tmux, nvim) -> possibly more for my self lol

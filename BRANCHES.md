# Branch structure
*The branch structure is unfinished - the follow descripes the ideal state of each branch*
## main
This branch is the main branch of the repository, it includes most of the latest changes, as far has they have been edited from my personal config.

## stable
This branch *should* include stable changes that have been tested to some degree (especially for the scripts).
**WARNING** - Currently nothing is stable.

## personal - *currently active on my laptop*
This branch includes all the most recent changes. These may however include changes that have been made to specifically match my personal setup.

## stow - *currently active on my desktop*
As I have recently switched to managing my dotfiles (and this repo) using stow, in the process of setting this up I also cleaned up the repository a bit.
Switching to stow on my laptop is planned and this branch will soon be merged to the main/personal branch.
